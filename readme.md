The OOO Decider
===============

At some point, I got tired of writing long, elaborate OOO messages every time I was out of the office for a few days; most of that information should be reusable, and you should only need to change what's changed (updated contact info, etc.).

At the same time, I was also looking for a way to efficiently manage communication while OOO. People should:

* be able to contact me if (and _only_ if) there's a real emergency;
* try some of my alternate contacts in the absence of a real emergency; and
* be able to get in touch with me when I'm back if they really need to talk to me.

Getting all of this text into a single message in a readable way was a bit of a pain. So, I decided to style use the amazing @akiany's JS decision wizard code into a decision tree people could use to decide what to do with me OOO.
